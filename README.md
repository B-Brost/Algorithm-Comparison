# Algorithm-Comparison

This code compares the time complexity of three different algorithms that solve the same problem. The problem is to determine if there are two numbers in a list that sum to zero. The three algorithms are brute-force, binary search, and two-pointer. The code times each algorithm for lists of increasing length and graphs the results.
